# AIM :

To implement and understand the concepts of Inheritance in C++ including Single, Multiple, Multilevel, and Hierarchical Inheritance with practical examples.

# Theory:

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It allows one class (derived/child) to acquire the properties and behavior of another class (base/parent).

Types of inheritance demonstrated:

Single Inheritance – One base class and one derived class.

Multiple Inheritance – Derived class inherits from two or more base classes.

Multilevel Inheritance – A chain of inheritance (grandparent → parent → child).

Hierarchical Inheritance – One base class with multiple derived classes.

# Algorithm

# Experiment 14A – Single Inheritance (Book Example)
Start the program.
Create a base class Book with data members and a function.
Create a derived class Novel that inherits from Book.
Add additional attribute genre in Novel.
Create an object of Novel and access parent and child members.
Display book details.
End the program.

# Experiment 14B – Multiple Inheritance (Book Example)
Start the program.
Create a base class Book with a member variable for title.
Create another base class Author with a member variable for author name.
Derive a class Novel that inherits from both Book and Author.
Add an additional attribute genre.
Accept values from the user and display complete book details.
End the program.

# Experiment 14C – Multilevel Inheritance (Animal Example)
Start the program.
Create a base class Animal with a function breathe().
Derive a class Dog from Animal and add attribute breed.
Derive another class Pet from Dog and add attribute name.
Create an object of Pet and access data/functions across all levels.
Display details.
End the program.


# Conclusion:
Successfully implemented Single, Multiple, Multilevel, and Hierarchical Inheritance in C++.
Learned how different types of inheritance demonstrate code reusability and real-world relationships between objects.
Each inheritance type provides a unique way to organize and structure programs using OOP concepts.
